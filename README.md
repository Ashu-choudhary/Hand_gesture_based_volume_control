--We created a system that uses a webcam to capture hand movements and process them with OpenCV to detect gestures. 

--We then assigned specific gestures to volume control commands, allowing users to adjust volume by moving their fingers. 

--This implementation provides an intuitive, touch-free interface for controlling volume through hand gestures.
